# SF-Test-Utility

Usually In large projects, the releases are performed in an iterative manner. Due to this kind of process, we need to have continuous updates on code coverage and test class related issues to avoid the last minute hassle. There are also multiple numbers of Salesforce Orgs as part of the deployment stack and it is a bit tedious to gather code coverage information across all the relevant orgs.
And there is always a need of good insight for the team to have an overview on where we stand in terms of code coverage/Test class failures.
